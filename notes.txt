building a Reddit Clone

 The application should allow a user to view a series of images, 
 upvote or downvote an image, see the top images (images with the largest net score), 
 view the net score that each image has accumulated, 
 and load additional images to vote on at the click of a button. 

You will likely want to store your images and votes in a database.


drag folder into terminal to install/initialize all of the dependecies/packages we will need
npm init -y (-y --> says yes to all of the questions )
npm i express
npm i body-parser
npm i node-fetch
npm i pug
npm i mongodb
// or npm i pg(?)

//COMMAND TO INSTALL THEM ALL AT ONCE 
npm i express pug body-parser node-fetch mongodb

can go into package.json to check to make sure all dependencies needed are downloaded

make a new file - app.js to start setting up our basic express file

BALL LIGHTNING: Spheres of light that appear during or after a thunderstorm.


do i want to give the users the option to post pictures or just post links to the pictures - or like devan said they send us the link to the webpage where the image is stored?  That way we can do like the weather app and pull in the image to display in an area using the image tag and some similar JS.

in my pug form the first field will be input text for the location of the natural wonder.
